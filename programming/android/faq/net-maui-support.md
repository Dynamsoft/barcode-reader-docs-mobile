## Does DBR android support .NET MAUI?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

.NET MAUI is the newest cross-platform frameowrk for creating mobile and desktop apps using C# from Microsoft. .NET MAUI is intended to be the evolution of Xamarin.Forms as Xamarin.Essentials is set to be deprecated in November 2022.

Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV), is the all-encompassing suite of the Dynamsoft products, currently only including the Barcode Reader and the Camera Enhancer. DCV MAUI is available upon request so if you are interested in using DBR with .NET MAUI, please get in touch with the Dynamsoft support team. 

Creating a publically available DCV MAUI package is certainly on the roadmap for us and we will update you with our progress.
