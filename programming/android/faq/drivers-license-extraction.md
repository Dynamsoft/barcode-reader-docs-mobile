# How is the driver's license sample able to extract the information into readable fields? Is DBR responsible for this function?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

In the Barcode Scanner X(mobile app), "US Driver's License" scenario is able to parse driver's information from driver's licenses.

At the moment, there is no external framework that is responsible for this function in the sample. However, the team is currently developing an edition of our complimentary product, the *Dynamsoft Code Parser*, that is compatible with the mobile platform.
