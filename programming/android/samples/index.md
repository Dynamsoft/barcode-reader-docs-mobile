## About Dynamsoft Barcode Reader Android Samples

Before you start viewing the samples, the following concepts may help you understand how to get started with Dynamsoft Barcode Reader.

### License

In the samples, there is a public trial license that is available for 7 days and a network connection is required for this license to work. If your license is expired, you can still request a 30-day trial license in the <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?product=dbr&utm_source=documents" target="_blank">customer portal</a>.

### Performance

In the samples, we are illustrating the performance settings from 3 different aspects: **Speed**, **Read Rate** and **Accuracy**. The parameter configurations are generally speed-friendly, read-rate-friendly and accuracy-friendly settings but might not be the best settings for your own usage scenario. The samples can help you on getting a basic understanding of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader parameters. Please feel free to <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/company/contact/" target="_blank">contact us</a> for further support on optimizing the parameters.

### Video Barcode Decoding

Most of the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader mobile samples are designed for video barcode decoding. Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE) is applied to the video barcode decoding samples to support the acquisition of video input. At the same time, some of the DCE features benefit the barcode decoding, which is illustrated in the samples. For more usage about DCE, please view more in <a href="https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/introduction/?ver=latest" target="_blank">DCE online documents</a>.
