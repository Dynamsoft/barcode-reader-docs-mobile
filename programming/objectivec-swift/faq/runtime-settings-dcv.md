## Are all the runtime settings included in the Barcode Reader module of the DCV packages?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

At the moment, the available runtime settings for the Barcode Reader module in DCV (all editions) are limited to the core ones, namely: *barcodeFormatIds*, *barcodeFormatIds_2*, *expectedBarcodeCount*, and *timeout*.

For reference, here is the [DBRRuntimeSettings](https://www.dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/programming/react-native/api-reference/interface-dbr-runtime-settings.html?ver=latest) page of the React Native edition of DCV.
