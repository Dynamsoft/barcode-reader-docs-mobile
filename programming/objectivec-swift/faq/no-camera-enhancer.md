## Can I use DBR iOS without the Camera Enhancer (DCE) module?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

Yes, that is indeed possible. Please refer to this [article](../samples/no-camera-enhancer.md). 

However, it is always recommended to use DBR in conjunction with DCE for the best results and performance.
