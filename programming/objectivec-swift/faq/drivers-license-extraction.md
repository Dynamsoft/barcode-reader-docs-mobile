# How is the driver’s license sample able to extract the information into readable fields? Is DBR responsible for this function?

[<< Back to FAQ index](index.md)

In the driver’s license sample, the code and resources responsible for extracting the driver license info is contained in the *PopDrivingLicenseView* folder. 

At the moment, there is no external framework that is responsible for this function in the sample. However, the team is currently developing an edition of our complimentary product, the *Dynamsoft Code Parser*, that is compatible with the mobile platform.
