# Dynamsoft Barcode Reader iOS Edition

Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) SDK iOS Edition is a barcode reading tool designed specifically for iOS developers.

Leveraging the efficiency and flexibility of the Objective-C/Swift language, DBR iOS Edition provides rich APIs for developers to easily integrate barcode reading functionality into your iOS applications.

As one of the functional products of the Dynamsoft Capture Vision (DCV) framework, DBR is also designed to seamlessly integrate with other DCV components and provide developers with a comprehensive set of image processing tools, which cover image capturing, content understanding, result parsing, and interactive workflow. If you are building such a capturing and processing solution, take a look at [Introduction to Dynamsoft Capture Vision]({{site.dcvb_architecture}}).

Furthermore, DBR provides a powerful parameter system in order to cope with various scenarios. Read <a href="{{site.parameters_reference}}index.html">Parameter Reference</a> for details.
